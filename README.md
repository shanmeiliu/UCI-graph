# UCI-graph
My attempt to join a research group by giving solution to an assigned problem on graph theory.
I was hoping to do my PhD and pursue an academic career, so I tried to join a research group in UCI, I solved the problem in one day, the professor thought 
it was a thorough solution
and I did successfully joined the group, but I didn't continue since I have too many other things to deal with and I feel I am not very passionate about 
research, it was a nice experience for me anyway
